The eGo tool
############

The python package eGo is a toolbox and application which connects the tool eTraGo
with a Optimization of flexibility options for transmission grids based on PyPSA
and eDisGo which analysis and optimization distribution grids. All those python
packages are part of the research project `open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.


eTraGo
------
The python package eTraGo provides a optimization of flexibility options for
transmission grids based on PyPSA.A speciality in this context is that transmission
grids are described by the 380, 220 and 110 kV in Germany. Conventionally the
110kV grid is part of the distribution grid. The integration of the transmission
and ‘upper’ distribution grid is part of eTraGo.

The focus of optimization are flexibility options with a special focus on
energy storages and grid expansion measures.


eDisGo
------
The python package eDisGo provides a toolbox for analysis and optimization
of distribution grids. It is closely related to the python project Ding0 as this
project is currently the single data source for eDisGo providing synthetic
grid data for whole Germany.
