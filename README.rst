eGo
======

Optimization of flexibility options for transmission grids based on eTraGo and eDisGo.

A speciality in this context is that transmission grids are described by the 380, 220 and 110 kV in Germany. Conventionally the 110kV grid is part of the distribution grid. The integration of the transmission (via eTraGo) and distribution grid (via eDisGo) is part of eGo.
